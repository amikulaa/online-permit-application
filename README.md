## Features

### Input Validation
The application includes robust input validation to check for data validity and prevent the submission of incorrect or malformed data. Additionally, it checks for HTML entities to enhance security and data integrity.

### Autofill Feature
The site integrates with internal county data to autofill previous data entries, simplifying the application process and reducing manual data entry for users.

### Insurance Alert
The application includes an alert system to notify users when their application is complete and insurance requirements have been met, ensuring compliance with all necessary regulations.

### Dynamic Field Display
Based on user selections, the application dynamically hides or shows certain fields to provide clear and intuitive user guidance throughout the application process.

### Drawing Feature
The site offers a drawing feature that allows users to sketch and annotate site plans directly within the application, enhancing the clarity and completeness of submitted applications.

## Template Reference
The design and layout of the Online Permit Application site were based on a one-page PDF template provided by the division. Despite the limited reference material, the site was successfully developed to meet the division's specific requirements and expectations.
